# Skin Disease Prediction

This project leverages deep learning to classify skin diseases from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built upon the EfficientNetB0 architecture. The model is integrated into an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload skin images and receive real-time predictions.

## üîç Overview

Skin diseases are prevalent worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to assist in the preliminary diagnosis of skin conditions by providing a tool that can classify images into specific disease categories, thereby supporting healthcare professionals and raising awareness among the general public.

## üß† Model Architecture

- **Base Model**: EfficientNetB0 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Custom Layers**:
  - Global Average Pooling
  - Dense Layer (128 units) with ReLU activation
  - Batch Normalization
  - Dropout (0.5)
  - Dense Layer (32 units) with ReLU activation
  - Batch Normalization
  - Dropout (0.5)
  - Output Layer (9 units) with Softmax activation

The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and trained with the sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## üñºÔ∏è Dataset

- **Source**: [Specify the dataset source, e.g., ISIC Archive, DermNet, or a custom dataset]
- **Classes**: 9 distinct skin disease categories
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Resizing images to 256x256 pixels
  - Normalization of pixel values
  - Data augmentation techniques applied to enhance model robustness ([GitHub - FridahKimathi/Skin-Disease-Image-Classifier-for-Accurate ...](https://github.com/FridahKimathi/Skin-Disease-Image-Classifier-for-Accurate-and-Accessible-Diagnosis?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [varshitha-g/Skin-Disease-Prediction - GitHub](https://github.com/varshitha-g/Skin-Disease-Prediction?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
